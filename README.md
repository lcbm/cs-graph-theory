## 🚀 Getting Started

First of all, you will need to clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lcbm/cs-graph-theory.git
```

Now, choose one of the [workspaces](#-workspaces) listed below, to start working in. Within each one, you'll find their own documentation - with requirements, usage instructions and everything else that you'll need, to start working.

```bash
$ cd <path/to/cs-graph-theory/workspace>
```

## 👩‍💻 Workspaces

### `/go`

This folder contains all of the course's exercises that were implemented in [Golang](https://golang.org). Also, exercises with the same scope will be under the same subfolder (e.g. all `graph` exercises will be under `/go/graph` and all `tree` exercises will be under `tree`). Feeling curious? Click [here](https://youtu.be/spKM5CyBwJA) to find out why!

### `/pyspark`

This folder contains all of the course's exercises that were implemented using [Apache PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html). In addition to Apache Pyspark, [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/graphframes/docs/_site/index.html) was also used during these exercises.
